1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,434
HKT48 vs NGT48  SashiKita Furious Battle!!

2
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,960
Good Evening!

3
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:12,403
Good Evening!
Good Evening! Nice to meet you!

4
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,223
Nice to meet you

5
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:17,422
Such a big scene setting
 but only two of us

6
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,365
Yes

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,061
It's quite lonely, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,369
Yes, it is

9
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:23,490
Actually, other members do not know that
we already started our programme

10
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:24,776
Ehh? really?

11
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,216
Yes!

12
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,708
It's because our first battle is
"Dokkiri" so no one knows about this!

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,436
This is such a wicked!

14
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:36,564
<The first battle is...

15
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,403
< to remember the names of the staffs
who they will first meet today!

16
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:44,051
<We held this Dokkiri for these two teams

17
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:49,111
<to evaluate their necessary skills in the show biz
or being entertainers

18
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,701
Let's see what is happening in the dressing room!

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,703
W ow! they look cheerful!

20
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:56,547
This is good, isn't it?

21
00:00:56,572 --> 00:01:00,705
We told them that camera men
will go into their room to take behind the scene atmosphere

22
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,115
 So don't worry! You will see everything in detail!

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,140
that is great

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,430
but they are too cheerful, aren't they?

25
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:07,455
yes

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,142
All right! The staff is going to meet them!

27
00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:17,302
Good morning!

28
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,869
Good morning!

29
00:01:19,895 --> 00:01:20,895
It's started!

30
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:22,708
Good morning!

31
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:23,902
It looks so real!

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,289
Mori-san can make everyone believe!

33
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:27,314
Good evening!

34
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:28,768
If it were me, I would also believe this.

35
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:32,254
I am the producer, Mori.

36
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,280
That AD looks strange.

37
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,309
Nice to meet you

38
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,559
Before we start recording

39
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:42,860
I would like to introduce our staffs
although some are still not here yet

40
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,993
yes

41
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:49,189
<The first staff is chief producer
Usui (bald head)

42
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,315
<and of course he is the faked staff

43
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:58,078
I am the chief producer
Usui, Nice to meet you!

44
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:00,801
Nice to meet you too

45
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:04,085
ah! Natsumikan can't hold her laugh already. This is bad!

46
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,188
I have very high hope with this programme

47
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,579
However, please be safe.

48
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,134
or else you will  have bald head like me,

49
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:18,629
Usui (bald head).

50
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:19,617
Bald head, the same as my name, Usui.

51
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,723
my name may be Usui but
I really do not want to be bald head.

52
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,798
Nako and Miku is laughing too out loud

53
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:24,822
so cuteee

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,052
< then Usui gives his hand-made rice balls to everyone.

55
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:34,706
<Will these young idols eat those hand-made rice balls
given by their first-met uncle?

56
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:38,065
It will be not good if I give only this side so..

57
00:02:38,538 --> 00:02:39,862
Lovetan got it already! What will she do with it?

58
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:40,823
She will never eat it!

59
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,896
trying to smell it like this is not good...Stop Stop Stop!!

60
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:48,563
That is a bad manner here

61
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,093
Ogiyuka looks displeased

62
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,235
Yes! NGT Team looks like they are disgusted

63
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,957
They look a little disgusted

64
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:58,720
may be it's because their pride in the rice

65
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:00,991
because they are from Niigata??

66
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:01,985
Yes, so they can't eat the rice from Tokyo anymore.

67
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,512
HKT starts having it!

68
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:07,416
Ah! Madoka also has it. I'm surprised!

69
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:08,574
Ah! Miku is so cute!

70
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,599
Everyone is having it

71
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,624
they looks happy having it

72
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:14,184
Delicious!

73
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,290
She also praised it!

74
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,710
but Lovetan is still not having it

75
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:22,678
<Next is an AD who is always fail, Shimada.

76
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,103
I am Shimada. I am an Assistant Director.

77
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:26,974
AKB48, everyone.....

78
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:30,425
No, they are not AKB...they are NGT and HGT!!!

79
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,142
Aren't they AKB?

80
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:32,609
Ah!

81
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,154
You didn't listen when they introduced themselves, didn't you?

82
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:37,907
Nice to meet you

83
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:40,687
Shimada!

84
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,305
Shimada!!

85
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,802
Kind-hearted! Katomina is so kind!

86
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:46,722
Sorry. Thank you.

87
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:50,854
I will try my best! Nice to meet you!

88
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,127
Nice to meet you

89
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:52,885
It looks like everyone cheers him on instead

90
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:57,898
<Next staff is a handsome AP, Ichuin.

91
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,746
<What will they react to this handsome staff??

92
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Excuse me

93
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:18,204
All HKT members are stunned for a second!!

94
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:18,957
It's like they were casted a spell on

95
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:22,234
I'd like to introduce myself a little. Please line up.

96
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:26,235
They look a little strange.

97
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,727
They response to him in very different way!

98
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,927
She smiles explicitly and looks so happy

99
00:04:29,952 --> 00:04:32,782
I am this programme AP, Ichuin. Nice to meet you.

100
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:35,012
Nice to meet you too!

101
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:38,182
As I am an AP so
I will always take care of everyone as much as possible

102
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,424
so please tell me if you need any help.

103
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,164
- Will it be ok!?
Yes, please do.

104
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:43,988
I am also an AP.

105
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:48,451
and I bought some macarons for everyone

106
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,129
look at every single of them reacting at him

107
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:52,071
It's totally different from earlier!

108
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:52,930
Yes, it really does

109
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:54,755
very different from when they got the rice balls

110
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,980
It's too different!

111
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,625
now they are all excited with it

112
00:04:58,071 --> 00:04:59,984
I am surprised that Katomina likes handsome guy!

113
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:00,704
yes, I'm also surprised

114
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:01,729
I'm shocked!

115
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,706
I didn't think they will act totally different like this!

116
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,750
but look at Nako-chan! She's still having the riceballs!

117
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,775
Cute one!!

118
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:11,317
Still having the riceball

119
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:15,968
Everyone! Be ready! Staffs will be ready soon!

120
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,103
Please wait a little longer.

121
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:17,643
yes

122
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,668
Excuse me

123
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,693
Thank you

124
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:23,225
Ah! She did it again!

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,665
wait wait wait! last time Rika-chan didn't help, did she?

126
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:28,181
Rika-chan is interesting

127
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,206
that's second time

128
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,308
It's not!

129
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,133
but she didn't help Shimada-san earlier.

130
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:41,950
<Next! Two more staffs will come and greet them.

131
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,600
I am the Sound staff, Goroumaru.

132
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:52,663
My surname is the same as a Rugby player.
but we are not related

133
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:53,702
Nice to meet you

134
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,432
Nice to meet you too

135
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:57,938
I am camera man, Nakamura.
Nice to meet you.

136
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,874
Nice to meet you too

137
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:03,301
<This faked camera man, Nakamura. He actually has a great influence on this programme.

138
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,480
<He actually is

139
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:08,295
because He is this TV channel producer!!

140
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,134
The genuine one

141
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,478
I am Nakamura. I am
the NTV station's producer

142
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,395
Nice to meet you

143
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,269
Nakamura-san. He is in a very high position.

144
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,779
but now he disguises as a camera man
- I see

145
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:24,108
So if you don't try to remember every staff names seriously and equally
You will never be able to memorize it surely

146
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,133
Yes, I agree

147
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,836
<After every staff has finished introducing themselves,

148
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,943
<Now is the time for our fake programme to start!

149
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:36,455
This programme will have these two teams fight each other!

150
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,268
but I am concerned about something

151
00:06:39,074 --> 00:06:39,638
which is?

152
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,556
Our 1st class army is not here.

153
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,981
Eh! Isn't it rude?

154
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:47,381
Just take a look! I got Natsumikan here and that made the result cleared!

155
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,109
3th army is here already!! hahaha!

156
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:51,641
Katomina-chan!
- yes!

157
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:54,151
What do you think about your true first TV programme?

158
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:56,203
Yes... I feel very thankful.

159
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,228
to whom?

160
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,703
NTV? isn't it?

161
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:00,992
so you do thank to NTV.

162
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,843
Let's start our first battle!

163
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,837
Who got the most powerful arm?

164
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,837
Furious Arm-wrestle!

165
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,504
I am just kidding!

166
00:07:09,617 --> 00:07:10,617
Eh!?

167
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,708
Today battle actually is

168
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,600
Which side can remember the staffs names more?!!!

169
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,986
Everyone! Take it easy!

170
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,211
Are you ok? Yamada-san

171
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:27,964
Yamada-san?

172
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,484
yes...

173
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,157
Your face is funny, Yamada-san.

174
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,192
No! My face is cute!

175
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:33,960
Cute face!!

176
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,518
Fight!

177
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,269
Charge!!

178
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:47,630
SashiKita furious battle!

179
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,187
First faked staff. Please come out.

180
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,211
Who is he?

181
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,937
Eh? Is he the faked one?

182
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:05,423
This staff told you that he was
the chief producer.

183
00:08:05,506 --> 00:08:08,876
but actually he is an actor
who is not related with this programme at all.

184
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:13,171
Let's see if you guys still remember his name?

185
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,748
This is easy.
- Are you sure?

186
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,492
because of this area?

187
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,333
finished?

188
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:20,905
Please show your answer!

189
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,614
Everyone got the right answer...

190
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,546
but Nako....

191
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,244
Nako is the only one with the different answer

192
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,678
She may got it correct.

193
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:35,826
yes, she may be only one who got it.

194
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,575
so let him tell his name.

195
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:40,409
Excuse me, may I have your name please?

196
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,975
Chief Producer, Usui.

197
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,568
Only Nako got the wrong answer!

198
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,593
This one is not that difficult, isn't it?

199
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,931
yes, it's easy

200
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:49,908
Nako answer was "Usu". She got some parts, did't she?

201
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:50,848
yes, I can only remember that.

202
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:53,537
If you could start the word correctly, the others wouldn't be any problem.

203
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,098
yes, just remember "Usu" (bald). that should be enough.

204
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:58,705
He played a gag which was not funny at all. Remember?

205
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:03,441
I think the riceball taste
was worse than the gag

206
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,220
Was it that bad?

207
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,653
I think because your tongue is used to high quality rice.

208
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,849
Yes, because we are from Niigata.

209
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,426
which is the place for growing rice, isn't it?

210
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,475
and the next one is

211
00:09:16,552 --> 00:09:17,552
What is his name?

212
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,739
He looks so real. It's difficult, isn't it?

213
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:22,231
yes, he is.

214
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:23,327
I wouldn't be surprised, if he were real.

215
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:24,685
Please show your answer

216
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,726
they are different?

217
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:29,893
Shimada-san , Shimada-san...

218
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:31,026
Santa-san?

219
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:32,051
I am sorry

220
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,904
Yamada-san's face is really funny, isn't it?

221
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:37,353
eh! look at the board! Not my face please!

222
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,373
She answered Santa-san

223
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,731
Looks like almost everyone answered Shimada-san

224
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:41,907
HKT

225
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,867
Shimada-san , Shimada-san , Yoshida-san, Toshio-san

226
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:47,927
Shimada-san , Shimada-san , Tano-san , Kobayashi-san

227
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:50,465
Please give us the answer! Your name is?

228
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:53,237
AD, Shimada.

229
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:57,939
So NGT got 4 correct answers

230
00:09:57,992 --> 00:10:01,856
and... 1 2 3 4! It's equal!

231
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,923
It's a great battle!

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,348
Trying to read his name backward and you'll find out that...

233
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
Damashi (faked)

234
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,245
No clue, huh?

235
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,270
Damn!

236
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,636
When he got blamed, what did you think? Mio-chan.

237
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,704
I thought "can he make it?"

238
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:24,054
He also called us "AKB" which was totally wrong....

239
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,747
yes

240
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:26,520
Is he alright? this guy...

241
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:30,350
How about you Natsumikan? Being called "AKB"

242
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,311
I felt glad though.

243
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,132
Yes, this is AKB. hahaha.

244
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,853
The next one is..

245
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:43,066
Ahhhh! This one... This one...He's that handsome man back there!

246
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:45,150
Cool!

247
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,022
Everyone is just too excited!

248
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,813
I'm sorry but he also is our faked staff and
you will never see him in the programme again!

249
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:51,838
Ehhhh~~~

250
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,260
I can see your sadness on your faces! You guys are just too obvious!

251
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Nooooooo

252
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,267
It changes nothing!!

253
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:01,601
By the way, I was surprised with Katomina's action back there.
To overly offer her help to him!

254
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,087
but I think there is someone who shocked me more than her!
It's Rika-chan!!!

255
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:06,192
Rika-chan!

256
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:09,894
Rika-chan, Do you know that how you react
 between riceball and macaron is totally different!

257
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,559
I didn't have riceball but macaron

258
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,673
did you? that's not good!

259
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,454
Let's see the answer.Show you answer!

260
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:19,553
NGT

261
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,245
Ikarashi-san, Ichuin-san..

262
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,677
What?? I can't read it.

263
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,701
Ijimei-san

264
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:29,521
and Ikemen or Nitto (wool hat)

265
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:30,546
Macaron-san

266
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:34,102
Oh! Katomina named him in such a international way!"Junk"

267
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,168
What's on your mind?

268
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,279
I just look at his face and...

269
00:11:38,304 --> 00:11:39,514
His face it too handsome, isn't it?

270
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:40,154
yes

271
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,822
All right! how about HKT?

272
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:42,847
Kiryuin-san

273
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:46,217
such a waste..Who is Kiryuin-san?

274
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,172
Ichuin-san

275
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:48,085
Sakurasaka-san

276
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,110
Takeo-san

277
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:50,172
Kobayashi-san

278
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:50,918
Saito-san

279
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:51,901
Ichuin-san

280
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:52,801
Ryuonchi-san

281
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:55,710
eh..but I got the feeling

282
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:56,502
do you?

283
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,175
It's too weird

284
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,941
The feeling is right, I guess.

285
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:59,813
Yes, but I don't think it the correct answer.

286
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:03,125
Let him tell his name
Your name, please.

287
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,849
Assistant Producer, Ichuin.

288
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:10,270
So each team got 2 correct answers
then 2 points for both team

289
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,303
What's on you mind when you see their answers?

290
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,207
well, Tada-san...

291
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:14,914
Ota-san!

292
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:15,423
Sorry, Ota-san

293
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,648
What!!! I can remember yours but you can't remember mine!!!

294
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:20,413
Don't mess it up! Ichuin!!!

295
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:25,294
I thought my charm got Ota-san

296
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,332
Really?

297
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:31,656
But actually I like the man who
is plain, not handsome.

298
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,593
So you are not my type!

299
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:34,922
Especially Natsumikan

300
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:37,450
Well, actually I....... By the way,
you are just a common guy?

301
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:38,263
I am a model

302
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:40,756
I see

303
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:42,282
Indeed! I can tell from his face!

304
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:45,367
"I can tell from his face"??
Who are you??? How can you dare saying something like that?

305
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:51,088
And the real AP is there.
Hanasuga-san.

306
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:52,113
Hanasuga-san

307
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:59,068
I guess everyone is thinking that
this kind of face is really the real AP.

308
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,528
Yes, I can tell from their faces

309
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,220
but still more handsome than ever

310
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:03,943
It's up to each person

311
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:04,811
I don't think so

312
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:06,615
And the next one is....

313
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,956
All right! Let's see what's his name

314
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:20,963
Goromaru-san

315
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:21,846
Goromaru

316
00:13:21,871 --> 00:13:23,436
Athelete Goromaru, Goromaru-san

317
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:24,461
Yasumura-san

318
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,122
What? Yasumura-san

319
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:29,260
Goromaru-san, Goromaru-san

320
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:30,311
next

321
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:31,109
Goromaru-san

322
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:33,651
Goromaru-san, Goromaru-san, Goromaru-san

323
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:34,902
Maeda-san, Goromaru-san

324
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,261
Maeda-san???

325
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:38,996
I'm sorry

326
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,028
Whyyyy?

327
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,673
It should be Goromaru-san then

328
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,097
Isn't it?

329
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:46,248
Let's listen the answer from him

330
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:49,278
Sound director, Goromaru.

331
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:52,855
It's the name that is easy to remember

332
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,792
but still why can't Katomina remember it

333
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:58,377
because it is not the trendy name any more so...

334
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,402
It still is!

335
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:02,005
Don't mess it up! That's not good.

336
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,818
<We got only one question left and NGT is only 1 point ahead

337
00:14:08,476 --> 00:14:13,258
< And the question that will decide this battle is
If you can't remember his name, that will be terrible.

338
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:14,972
Who?

339
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:17,036
He is the real producer!

340
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,949
He is the real deal of this channel

341
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:21,423
And last question is him

342
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:27,217
I can't remember at all

343
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,281
Who is he???

344
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:30,389
Who is heee??

345
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:34,431
Well, he introduced himself as a camera man but

346
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:38,354
He actually is this programme producer
the real one

347
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,851
He's genuine

348
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:43,800
If you can't answer his name correctly or make him feel displeased

349
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,781
He can end this programme immediately!

350
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,371
What?? I'm scared!!

351
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,863
To end this programme right now is also possible

352
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,816
It's up to you guys

353
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,308
Do you think that everyone still remembers your name?

354
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:59,437
I think they all can't remember my existence at all
They will never make it

355
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:03,193
I see, but do you still want them
to remember your name?

356
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:06,544
I think so...If anyone can remember mine, I think I'm going to help her in this programme

357
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,472
Honestly

358
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:11,022
that makes sense

359
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:11,382
yes

360
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,007
And that name is also his real name.

361
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,765
I didn't hear what he said back there

362
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,622
That changes nothing. He is still our producer.

363
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:23,193
I've just asked Rikatan here
and she also can't remember his name

364
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:26,638
And that is already recorded so beware of what will happen

365
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:29,275
Seriously, next episode you guys may not be able
to be here anymore.

366
00:15:29,993 --> 00:15:31,660
So it's the time to see your answers

367
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,934
Nakamura-san, Nakamura-san

368
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,569
nakata-san

369
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:36,209
Kobayashi-san

370
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:37,206
Nakamura-san, Nakamura-san

371
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:38,039
Fukushima-san

372
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:38,854
Kanda-san

373
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:39,767
It's not. It's Samuta-san.

374
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,276
Sorry, Samuta-san

375
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,355
Well, sorry. Samuta-san

376
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
Sorry

377
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:45,218
Next is

378
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:46,626
Kobayashi-san , Nakamura-san

379
00:15:46,651 --> 00:15:47,723
Yoshimura-san, Takamura-san

380
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,196
Kobayashi-san, Tomita-san

381
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,093
Naoe-san

382
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:51,118
Yoshimura-san

383
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:54,057
Still can't tell what the correct one is

384
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,082
It's too various

385
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:56,174
Yamada-san, Are you ok?

386
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:59,235
Your face is like that for a while already

387
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:02,004
It's such a funny face if you see it through the monitor

388
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:05,843
It's really funny

389
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,394
I'd like to tell that Yamada always call herself
"Tomonaga Mio-san"

390
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,256
Eh? really? I see

391
00:16:11,281 --> 00:16:13,131
It's not! Just kidding! It is.

392
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,303
Other members also say they think the same

393
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:19,391
I don't think so
- it really is

394
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,159
I don't like it

395
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,808
What do you think, Mio-chan?

396
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,846
I'd like to cry. I don't like it at all.

397
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,542
Let's have both to stand next to each other

398
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,439
Let's see

399
00:16:28,464 --> 00:16:29,621
Are you sure?

400
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:30,088
Yes

401
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,272
I don't want to...or else everyone will know the truth

402
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,126
What truth?

403
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:34,284
I'd like to see it

404
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:39,334
< Then will Tomonaga and Yamada look alike?

405
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,426
Come and stand close to each other

406
00:16:41,235 --> 00:16:42,389
They look alike when they are smiling

407
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,014
yes, they are

408
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:46,656
yes

409
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:52,269
It looks like the older sister who has just become a city girl
 and the younger sister who still lives in suburb

410
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:57,118
All right! Let him tell us what his name is

411
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:57,911
What's your name?

412
00:16:57,936 --> 00:17:00,705
Nice to meet you
Everyone, nice to meet you

413
00:17:00,737 --> 00:17:03,579
NTV Producer
Nakamura

414
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:09,203
Yeah! I got it!

415
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:13,196
HKT48 got 4 points
and NGT got 1 point

416
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,421
Are you guys ok?

417
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:17,287
yes, are you guys really ok?

418
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:20,269
From my observation it looks like
Otaki often got the correct answer

419
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:21,466
Yes, I got it all correct!

420
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,065
That's great!

421
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,239
Her appearance may look like that but
she is really a good serious girl

422
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,203
It may look incoherent

423
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,743
I do take it seriously when it's about relationship

424
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:29,918
so I always observe everyone

425
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,448
And that's all we got today!

426
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,585
The result is

427
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:39,642
NGT48 got 22 points

428
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:44,066
HKT48 got 24 points

429
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:47,292
HKT48 is the winner

430
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,548
And that is our first furious battle!

431
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,108
Katomina-chan, what do you think?

432
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:58,898
I'm quite annoyed with my own bad memory.

433
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,458
so you're annoyed with yourself

434
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,023
Are you ok?

435
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,243
Where is the luxury cafe?

436
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,576
It's totally different from the picture

437
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:09,046
<The members will go travelling after this

438

Still not there yet? Eh?

452
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:56,249
Well, I still can't see anywhere that
looks like the place we are going to

453
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:57,141
Can't find it at all

454
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,267
Are we lost?

455
00:18:58,292 --> 00:18:59,200
wrong way?

456
00:18:59,225 --> 00:18:59,867
but

457
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:01,068
Don't tell me that..

458
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,547
Wait wait. Look!

459
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:06,588
Eh? It's old.

460
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,663
so it's different from what you imagined then

461
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,696
yes, totally different

462
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:14,604
it ruined what I imagined
It should be a luxury cafe, shouldn't it?

463
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,337
but old places always get more delicious foods though.

464
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,257
let's try

465
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,003
ok

466
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:19,983
Welcome!

467
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:20,820
ok, let's get in

468
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:21,845
Excuse me

469
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,258
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here is your curry ramen

470
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,283
oh! here it is

471
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,202
it made me hungrier

472
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:29,841
looks delicious

473
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,921
but it's quite different from other ramens

474
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:32,801
it is

475
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:34,098
it's served with rice

476
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:34,933
great

477
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:35,958
Thank you

478
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,120
It looks great

479
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,326
Curry rice is here

480
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:39,892
Thanks

481
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,096
eh? why does it come with dessert?

482
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,121
Thanks

483
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:44,184
Served with dessert is great, isn't it?

484
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,151
Omelet rice is here!
- wow

485
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,579
Shall we eat and talk at the same time?

486

487
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,256

490
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:00,425
really?

491
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,922
It's not too spicy

492
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:02,729
let's eat

493
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:05,633
I'm hungry so it's more delicious

494
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:08,623
It is so delicious

495
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:14,433
< Nishigata applied for AKB but
 couldn't make it and failed 6 years ago

496
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,591
< And got qualified to be part-time AKB

497
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,635
< when she was 18 years old

498
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,541
< and in the 2nd draft

499
00:20:21,566 --> 00:20:23,966
< she became an official NGT member

500
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:28,684
< The thing that pushed her into 
sadness and disappointment is

501
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you remember when we were at our part-time performance
It was only me who got blamed

502
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,025
yes, I do

503
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,119
yes, it really did

504
00:20:37,144 --> 00:20:38,085
The dance instructor was very strict

505
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,000
yes, very strict

506
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:41,471
you were only the one who got blamed

507
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:42,669
I see, It's you, Gatapi

508
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:47,571
That time I felt like being here was not the place for me
I was so stressed out

509
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:51,121
In the 3rd round of the draft qualification

510
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:57,496
where I got qualified
but I was not sure which way I should take.

511
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:58,193
yes

512
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,283
I thought that I will not go on the actual day

513
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,265
yes, it sounded very serious

514
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,955
I told myself that it's not my place
and I shouldn't go

515
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Gatapi!!

516
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,810
That's your story, I've just known

517
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,525
Here is tissue

518
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,061
Thanks, Seiji-chan

519
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:20,086
You looks terrible

520
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,785
You're older than me. Don't be like this

521
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,065
Do you know that the older, the easier to cry.

522
00:21:25,566 --> 00:21:28,580
I'm just 16 but she is 20 already

523
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,727
< After this CM, we have next episode sample for everyone

524
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,459
When you failed so many times,
 did you think to give up on your dream?

525
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:39,951
I did, I seriously thought that I don't belong to this place

526
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:49,543
< Please check the full episode of Ogino's sad story on Hulu

527
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:54,443
< Next episode! Which member will be selected
from the foreigner that they were fake idol!

528
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:04,659
I love you

529
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,573
I want you I need you

530
00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:08,839
You are the fake one!

531
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:13,019
<This will be the first time for NGT members to get face slammed in cake
